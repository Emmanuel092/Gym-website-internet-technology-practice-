                  <p > 
                  
    We’re Lakostoria Gym , a totally new way to exercise. Affordable, high-spec nationwide gyms, that make absolutely everybody feel welcome.
    Whatever your starting point, and wherever you want to go, we can help.So we’re for everyone who’s had enough of the unbelievably-expensive-monthly-contract gym, or the make-me-feel-judged-the-moment-I-walk-through-the-door gym.
  As you might expect we’re growing fast, and there are new Gyms popping up all over the country. And it’s not just new members we’re winning – we won the ‘Budget Gym of the Year Award’ at the National Fitness Awards 2011.  </p>
                                   
  <p> We believe in balance
    Helping the world to achieve a healthy balance, to be more precise. We think everybody deserves the support to reach their goals whatever they are, and without paying a premium or being tied into a contract.
    That’s why we offer no pressure membership that you can stop and start whenever you want. Instead of being tied to a year’s contract, and opening hours that just don’t suit lots of us, like shift workers and students, you can have exactly the way you want it.
    For a start we’re open 24/7, almost every day of the year. And we won’t make you sign a contract that ties you in. All we’ll do is give you the exact amount of encouragement and support you need, and make sure you’ve got the very latest kit to do it on (we were one of the first fitness centres in the UK to introduce Myride®️ indoor cycling and 24/7 video-link pilates, yoga, dance and aerobics classes within our separate studio rooms, don’t you know)
